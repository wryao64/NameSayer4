                       ABOUT / SETUP
################################################################
NameSayer is an app to help you practice how to pronounce names.

You can load in a database of names in .wav format by copying them to the assets/names folder (as long as they are in a format simillar to the file names you already see like "se206_2-5-2018_15-23-50_Mason").

################################################################
                    Selecting Names to practice
################################################################
Once the app is opened you can select a single or multiple names to practice by clicking on them from the list on the left and then pressing select name. They will appear to the list on the right. You can remove selected names or shuffle the order. Press "Practise" when you want to practice them.

                       Practicing names
################################################################
Once you are practicing names, you can listen to how they are pronounced from the database by pressing the "Play Database" button. You can set a recording quality for the database recording and this information will also be saved to a file called "quality.txt" in the same directory as the app (the jar file).

On the left you can navigate through selected names to practice by clicking on them. On the right you record yourself practicing, see your previous recordings for the name, sorted by date, and play them.

################################################################
                       Recording Names
################################################################
Press the record button from the practicing names screen. Then press record when you are ready. You will be given 5 seconds to say the name you see, and given an option to listen back to the recording before choosing if you want to save the recording.

You can also test if your mic works from the first screen. Press the test mic button on the right. You will then be recorded for a few seconds and the recording will immediately be played back to you so you can hear your mic levels

################################################################
                            Notes
################################################################
Names that are spelt the same are treated as duplicate names. From the database only 1 name will be loaded into the app. You can delete duplicates from the database if you want to use a particular one (or maybe in version 4 of this assignment you will get more choice owo).
Names that start will lower-case letters are accepted in case of some names like "van Gogh".

Thanks if you read all the way down to here, love your work <3.
