## About / Setup
The target users of this app are students practising the names of their classmates.
To help it appeal to students, there are features like:
- a dark background to make it easy on eyes when students are grinding away at night
- rewards for practising names in the form of pictures of cute animals

NameSayer is an app to help you practise how to pronounce names.
Names come from a database (that can be found in the assets/names directory).

The file structure should be all set up for you to start staight away.

## Selecting Names to practise

Once the app is opened you can enter a name to practise or upload a text file of names.
After this you can further change what names you want to practise by adding/removing from the list or uploading another file of names to add on. You can also shuffle the order.
You can always come back here later to change some more names.
Sometimes names might not be in the database. You can still create a name but may not be unable to listen to parts of it. You can still practise with your own recordings of the name.

## Practising and Recording names

Once you are practising names, you can scroll through using the arrows or the list of names at the top.
You can listen to how they are pronounced (if avaliable in the database). For names that use a single recording from the database and are not concatenated, you can flag the recording as being of bad quality. This information will also be saved to a file called "badQualityRecordings.txt" in the same directory as the app.
You can compare your recordings with the how the name is pronounced by pressing 'Compare'. The name pronunciation will be played along with your recording and this will be repeated the amount of times you set it to be.

You can also test if your mic works by pressing 'Test Mic'. There is a meter to show your mic input.

Pressing the 'Practise Recording' button will bring you to a screen where you can listen to how the name is pronounced, practise saying it and then record yourself. Press record when you are ready to record. You will be given 5 seconds to say the name you see, and given an option to listen back to the recording before choosing if you want to save the recording. There is a meter to show your mic input while recording.

## Take a Break / Rewards

Sometimes studying and practising names gets boring so the app has rewards to cheer students up as well as provide motavation.
Pictures of cute animals will randomly be acquired when you use NameSayer. You will be notified once you get a new picture and can view them by pressing "Take a Break".
